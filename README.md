## About this Course
Learn to code in Java and improve your programming and problem-solving skills. You will learn to design algorithms as well as develop and debug programs. Using custom open-source classes, you will write programs that access and transform images, websites, and other types of data. At the end of the course you will build a program that determines the popularity of different baby names in the US over time by analyzing comma separated value (CSV) files. 

After completing this course you will be able to:
1. Edit, compile, and run a Java program;
2. Use conditionals and loops in a Java program;
3. Use Java API documentation in writing programs. 
4. Debug a Java program using the scientific method;
5. Write a Java method to solve a specific problem;
6. Develop a set of test cases as part of developing a program;
7. Create a class with multiple methods that work together to solve a problem; and
8. Use divide-and-conquer design techniques for a program that uses multiple methods.

### Week 1: Fundamental Java Syntax and Semantics

## Note:
Codes run in a custom Bluej Java programming Development Environment made by Duke's University especially for this course. If you have already downloaded a version of BlueJ, you will need to uninstall and download [this one](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//downloads/bluej.php) to get the edu.duke library.
